Introduction
============


Documentation for Crafty.js

This documentation is not meant to document every function there is in Crafty.js, quite opposite! It will be a introduction on the different fields that Crafty.js helps you on, like how you will get started moving things around and reponds to event, when you for an example hit something.

It will make you understand Crafty.js better, and make you going, and perhaps give you the courage to look at the API documentation yourself where every Crafty.js function is documentated.
